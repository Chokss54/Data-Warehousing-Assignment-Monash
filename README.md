# Data-Warehousing-Assignment-Monash
This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for a data warehousing assignment. The project involves designing, implementing, and querying a data warehouse using SQL. It serves as a demonstration of my knowledge and skills in the data warehousing field.

## Client Requirements
Please refer to the [Client Requirements](Problem Description - MonEquip Data Warehouse.md) file to familiarise with the client requirements

## Design Solution: Star Schema
The data warehouse design follows the star schema model, which includes fact and dimension tables optimized for querying and reporting.
Please refer to the [Design Solution](design/Schema Design.pdf) file for the star schema solution

## Data Pre-processing & Cleaning
The raw data provided by the client undergoes thorough pre-processing and cleaning to ensure it is prepared for implementation use.
Please refer to [Data Cleaning](SQL implementation/Data_Cleaning.sql) script file for implementation.

## Design Implementation
The design solution (star model) is implemented in SQL.
Please refer to the []() script file for implementation.
